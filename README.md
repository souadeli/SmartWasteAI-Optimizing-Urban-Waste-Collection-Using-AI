# SmartWasteAI

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

SmartWasteAI uses machine learning and sensor data to predict optimal garbage collection times and routes, reducing costs, emissions, and overflows in urban waste management systems.

## Background

Urban waste overflow and inefficient pickup routes are a major issue in many cities. Bins are either collected too often (wasting fuel and labor) or too late (causing hygiene issues).

This is how you make a list, if you need one:
* Overflowing public bins
* Inefficient pickup schedules
* Carbon emissions from waste trucks

My motivation: I live in a city where trash bins often overflow, causing bad smell and health risks. This idea could help municipalities become smarter and cleaner.

## How is it used?

Municipalities equip public trash bins with weight or fill-level sensors. The data is collected daily and used to train a machine learning model that predicts:
- When each bin will be full
- The best pickup route for trucks

The dashboard lets planners:
- View bins nearing capacity
- Get route suggestions
- Improve collection schedules

## Data sources and AI methods

- Sensor data from smart bins (simulated or open city data)
- Weather and public event schedules (affect fill rates)
- AI methods: Regression for bin fill predictions, K-means or route optimization, reinforcement learning for scheduling
- Visualization: Matplotlib/Plotly in Python

Example data source:
[Open City Sensor Data](https://data.gov)

| Feature        | Source             |
|----------------|--------------------|
| Fill-level     | IoT sensors        |
| Location       | GPS/Bin mapping    |
| Event calendar | Open city datasets |

## Challenges

This project does _not_ solve:
* Areas without sensor infrastructure
* Multi-bin sorting (plastic, glass, etc.)
* Unexpected events like illegal dumping

Ethical considerations:
- Data privacy of location data
- Ensuring open access to algorithm recommendations

## What next?

To move forward:
- Partner with a local municipality
- Add real-time dashboard
- Deploy prototype for 3â€“6 months
- Gather feedback and iterate
