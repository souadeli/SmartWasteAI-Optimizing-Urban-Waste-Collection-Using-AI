# SmartWasteAI

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

SmartWasteAI is an AI-powered system that optimizes urban waste collection routes using real-time bin data, traffic conditions, and weather forecasts. It aims to reduce operational costs and improve sanitation efficiency in cities.

## Background

Urban waste collection is often inefficient, causing overflowing bins or wasted fuel due to unnecessary pickups. This project addresses:
* Poor route planning by city sanitation departments
* Environmental impacts of excess fuel use
* Overflowing waste bins in high-density areas

**Motivation:** Living in a busy neighborhood, I regularly see bins overflowing while others nearby are half-empty. SmartWasteAI is my way of using AI to tackle this everyday problem.

## How is it used?

Sanitation planners and waste truck drivers use the system to:
* Monitor bin fill levels via IoT sensors or citizen input
* Generate optimal pickup routes that adapt to traffic and weather
* Predict future fill levels and plan accordingly

Citizens can optionally report full bins via a mobile app.  
The system is especially useful in urban areas during high-traffic hours or after public events.

## Data sources and AI methods

### Data sources:
* IoT bin sensors (or crowdsourced mobile app data)
* Google Maps Traffic API
* OpenWeatherMap API
* Historical bin collection records from municipalities

### AI methods:
* **Regression models** – predict when bins will reach capacity
* **Reinforcement learning / optimization** – calculate efficient collection routes
* **Anomaly detection** – spot unusual fill patterns or faulty sensors

| Technique           | Use Case                         |
|--------------------|----------------------------------|
| Regression          | Bin fill level forecasting       |
| Reinforcement learning | Route optimization            |
| Anomaly detection   | Faulty bin or sensor detection   |

## Challenges

* Sensor data may be noisy or unavailable in some areas
* Integration with legacy municipal systems
* Scaling to areas with poor mobile/data infrastructure
* Ethical concern: data privacy of app users and workers must be ensured

## What next?

To grow this project:
* Create a prototype using Python and Flask with simulated bin data
* Partner with a municipality for a pilot program
* Integrate with existing GPS truck routing systems
* Expand to include recycling optimization and citizen reward systems
